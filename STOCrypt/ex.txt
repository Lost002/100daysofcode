so, we use a class because if you want this can be used a library. if its not being used as a library the "if __name__ == "__main__":" conditional will only run if your running the file ex: "python3 main.py", either way you run it the class will execute, if you want to encrypt, you call "--encrypt" or "-e" as the first argument, and the 2nd will be what you want to encrypt, when encrypting the program goes throgh every character in your given text and choose a random number 0-9, it then adds that number to the ascii value "ord()" of the character. then, the shift, and newly made, shifted ascii value are added to a string "encrypted" and a "%" is added as a seperator. When decrypting we first split the encryption at every "%", this makes a list with every encrypted character. we go through every entry of this list and read the first character so we know the shift. (this is why we only used a 0-9 range shift.) after knowing the shift we read everything after after the firstcharacter by slicing out that first character. we then subtract the shift from that value and we now know the ascii value of said character. we then simply add that ascii value to a variable "decrypted" after using "chr()" to convert it to a utf-8 character
